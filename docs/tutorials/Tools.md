## Binding of Isaac (Flash Version)
### Spider Mod
**Download Link:** [Spider Mod v09.1 for WotL 1.48](https://mega.nz/file/gYhTCbLK#AOBnB6qYxkBWXGhLmMFPHsEF8N-RmD7qoqAJi8s3GBs)

Extended version of the default game with extra features, bugfixes and modding support. Its a standalone application and does work without having the main game installed.

This does not contain or work with the Eternal Update!

#### Video Tutorial
Here is a video tutorial on how to install Spidermod: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0vagIRSgPc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0vagIRSgPc)

#### Install instructions (outdated and incomplete)
1. Download and unpack the zip file in any folder and directory you want.
3. You may need to install Adobe Flash Player, for it to work. This can be a bit complicated because Flash Player is no longer access and downloadable because Flash is no longer supported.
2. You may also need to set your Windows system time back to 2018, since Flash player is no longer supposed to work on newer systems
4. Start the "Binding of Isaac WOTL SpiderMod.exe" file to play the mod

If the window doesn't display anything or you have some "Class not registered" error, download Adobe Flash Player for **Internet Explorer**. [!PUT LINK HERE!]

### Community Remix mod
**Download Link:** [Community Remix mod](https://mega.nz/file/Xp00AIjL#FP_8hI46jtN_zB0O1C8Z2neU55hQdWr1oqOgoua8gEk)

A mod that adds a lot of new content to the game. **Requires Spider Mod to work!**

#### Installation instructions
1. Download and unpack Spider Mod
2. Download Community Remix mod
3. Replace `.../Spidermod/Data/IsaacSpiderMod.isc` with the downloaded Community Remix mod file or the same name
4. Start Spider mod
