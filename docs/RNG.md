# Class "RNG"

The RNG class provides a mechanism to produce seeded random numbers. This is used heavily by both the game and mods.

## Constructors
### RNG () {: aria-label='Constructors' }
[ ](#){: .abrep .tooltip .badge }
#### [RNG](RNG.md) RNG ( ) {: .copyable aria-label='Constructors' }

New RNG objects are always initialized with a seed of 2853650767. Thus, after invoking the constructor, you must set the seed of the new RNG object to the initial seed that you want. In some cases, this can just be a new random number between 1 and 4294967295. Use the `Random` global function to get a starting seed for these cases, (but check to make sure that values of 0 are not allowed, since that will crash the game). However, in most cases, seeding with a completely random number would be a bug in your mod, because all behavior in Isaac should be deterministic based on the starting seed of the run, or the seed of the level, or the seed of the room, and so on.

When setting the seed, it is recommended to use a shift index of 35, which is what most of the game's internal functions use. Document this number as a constant using SHOUTING_SNAKE_CASE so that you avoid using [magic numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_number_(programming)) in your program.

???+ example "Example code"
    ```lua
    -- This is the ShiftIdx that Blade recommended after having reviewing the game's internal functions.
    -- Any value between 0 and 80 (inclusive) should work equally well.
    -- https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v008i14/xorshift.pdf
    local RECOMMENDED_SHIFT_IDX = 35

    local game = Game()
    local seeds = game:GetSeeds()
    local startSeed = seeds:GetStartSeed()
    local rng = RNG()
    rng:SetSeed(startSeed, RECOMMENDED_SHIFT_IDX)
    local myRandomNumber = rng:RandomInt(4) -- Will be either 0, 1, 2, or 3.
    ```

## Functions

### Get路Seed () {: aria-label='Functions' }
[ ](#){: .abrep .tooltip .badge }
#### int GetSeed ( ) {: .copyable aria-label='Functions' }

Returns the current seed of the RNG object.

___
### Next () {: aria-label='Functions' }
[ ](#){: .abrep .tooltip .badge }
#### int Next ( ) {: .copyable aria-label='Functions' }

"Iterates" the RNG's seed to the next random number in the psuedo-random sequence. (The internal PRNG algorithm used is [Xorshift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xorshift).)

___
### Random路Float () {: aria-label='Functions' }
[ ](#){: .abrep .tooltip .badge }
#### float RandomFloat ( ) {: .copyable aria-label='Functions' }
Returns a number between 0 and 1. This is inclusive on the lower end and exclusive on the higher end.

Note that this will automatically call the `RNG.Next` method before retrieving the random number. Since this mutates the RNG object, you should use this method with care.

???+ example "Example code"
    ```lua
    -- This is the ShiftIdx that Blade recommended after having reviewing the game's internal functions.
    -- Any value between 0 and 80 (inclusive) should work equally well.
    -- https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v008i14/xorshift.pdf
    local RECOMMENDED_SHIFT_IDX = 35
    local MY_ENTITY_CHANCE = 0.3 -- 30%

    function shouldEntityDoThing(entity)
      local rng = RNG()
      rng:SetSeed(entity.InitSeed, RECOMMENDED_SHIFT_IDX)
      local randomChance = myRNG:RandomFloat()
      return randomChance < MY_ENTITY_CHANCE
    end
    ```
___
### Random路Int () {: aria-label='Functions' }
[ ](#){: .abrep .tooltip .badge }
#### int RandomInt ( int Max ) {: .copyable aria-label='Functions' }
Returns a number between 0 and the max value. It is inclusive on the lower end and exclusive on the higher end.

Note that this will automatically call the `RNG.Next` method before retrieving the random number. Since this mutates the RNG object, you should use this method with care.

???+ example "Example code"
    ```lua
    local RECOMMENDED_SHIFT_IDX = 35

    function getZeroOneTwoOrThree(seed)
      local rng = RNG()
      rng:SetSeed(seed, RECOMMENDED_SHIFT_IDX)
      return rng:RandomInt(4) -- Will generate 0, 1, 2, or 3.
    end
    ```
___
### Set路Seed () {: aria-label='Functions' }
[ ](#){: .abrep .tooltip .badge }
#### void SetSeed ( int Seed, int ShiftIdx ) {: .copyable aria-label='Functions' }
Set the seed of a given RNG object. Seed needs to be a positive integer number that is **not** 0. Otherwise it can cause crashes. ShiftIdx must be between 0 and 80 (inclusive) or it can cause crashes.

???+ bug "Bug"
    If the seed of an RNG object is set to 0, the game will crash after invoking a method like `Next()`, `RandomInt()`, etc.


???+ example "Example code"
    ```lua
    local myRNG = RNG()
    myRNG:SetSeed(Random(), 1)
    ```
